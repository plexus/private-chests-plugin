(ns lambdaisland.private-chests
  "Implementation of private chests with shop capabilities

  Start by naming a chest @username, only that user will be able to break the
  chest or interact with its inventory.

  You can add items in the chest that form a price list, e.g name the item \"16
  Golden Carrots : 3 Diamonds\" and put it in the chest. Now when someone clicks
  on a stack of golden carrots in the chest, it will exchage the golden carrots
  and diamonds between the two inventories.

  Current shortcomings:
  - It's very easy to slightly (or deliberately) misspell the username, causing
    unbreakable chests
  - Placing a chest left of a single chest will merge them and override the
    name, to be safe always put double chests
  - Make it possible to use the display name of renamed items in the price list
